# White_Validations

This Library will help you (Developers) to perform basic generic validations for all of your standard 
methods throwing your custom exceptions and/or custom messages of errors and useful information for your callers.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
You can import all of the validators to your class so far has implemented its first method. 
The caller can just import all the validations on to his/her own classes with a static import and use them as local. 
For example:<br>
```java
 	void myMethod(String myParam){
  	    notNullValidation(myParam);
  	    //My process definition
 	}
```
you can also do this:
```java
 	    notNullValidation(msg("This parameter must not be null because is vital to complete my process"),MyProjectException.class,parameter1,parameter2);
```
And the library will encapsulate the exception (if thrown) under your specified exception.
the methods accept, any number of parameters or collections
